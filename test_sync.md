# Testing Plan for Finanza Mobile Synchronization Fix

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Online Mode Testing (with server running)
**Setup**: Desktop server running on network IP (e.g., 192.168.1.148:8080)

**Test Steps**:
1. Configure server IP in SettingsActivity
2. Login with valid credentials (teste@gmail.com / 654321)
3. Verify login success and connection maintained
4. Check if data appears in:
   - MainActivity (home screen with balance/recent transactions)
   - MovementsActivity (list of movements)
   - AccountsActivity (list of accounts)
   - CategoriaActivity (list of categories)
5. Add new transaction via MainActivity
6. Verify sync to server
7. Check data persistence after app restart

**Expected Results**:
- Login succeeds with server data download
- All screens show synchronized data from server
- New transactions sync bidirectionally
- UI updates automatically after sync

### 2. Offline Mode Testing (no server)
**Setup**: Server not running or unreachable

**Test Steps**:
1. Attempt login with previously valid credentials
2. Verify fallback to local authentication
3. Create local data (accounts, categories, transactions)
4. Navigate between screens
5. Restart app and verify data persistence

**Expected Results**:
- App works fully offline
- Local data is maintained
- All UI screens function normally
- No crashes from sync attempts

### 3. Transition Testing (offline to online)
**Setup**: Start offline, then start server

**Test Steps**:
1. Use app offline and create local data
2. Start desktop server
3. Configure server settings in app
4. Trigger sync (by opening activities)
5. Verify bidirectional synchronization

**Expected Results**:
- Local data syncs to server
- Server data downloads to app
- No data loss during transition

## Code Changes Summary

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Connection Management**: Login now maintains connection for subsequent operations
2. **Data Retrieval**: Added methods to fetch data FROM server (not just push TO server)
3. **UI Synchronization**: All activities now trigger sync and refresh on resume
4. **Database Consistency**: Fixed database naming across all activities
5. **Error Handling**: Improved timeout and error handling for sync operations

### Key Files Modified:
- `ServerClient.java`: Added data retrieval methods, fixed connection flow
- `SyncService.java`: Implemented bidirectional sync with server response parsing
- `AuthManager.java`: Added auto-sync trigger after login
- `MainActivity.java`: Enhanced UI refresh after sync
- `MovementsActivity.java`: Added sync integration
- `AccountsActivity.java`: Added sync integration  
- `CategoriaActivity.java`: Added sync integration

## Technical Details

### Synchronization Flow:
1. User logs in â†’ Connection established
2. AuthManager triggers full sync after successful login
3. SyncService fetches data from server (categories, accounts, movements)
4. Server responses parsed and stored in local SQLite database
5. UI activities refresh to show updated data
6. Subsequent operations sync in background

### Protocol Commands Used:
- `LOGIN` - Authentication
- `LIST_CATEGORIAS` - Fetch categories
- `LIST_CONTAS` - Fetch accounts
- `LIST_MOVIMENTACOES` - Fetch movements
- `ADD_CATEGORIA` - Send category to server
- `ADD_CONTA` - Send account to server
- `ADD_MOVIMENTACAO` - Send movement to server

The main issue was that the original implementation only pushed local data to the server but never fetched server data back to display in the UI. This has been completely fixed with bidirectional synchronization.
